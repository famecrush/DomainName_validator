# simple_osint_tools
These are some simple OSINT tools to check if the domain name is a validate or not and for enumeration and some few others.
Now a days in the field of penetration testing we are using some advance and automated tools to reduce our time and energy 
but we forgot that we humans are the one who made machines and all these tools. So I think that we should not forget the manual
testing which are done by us.
These scipts are written by me when I was at learning and practising phase.
NOTE :- ALL THESE TOOLS OR WE CAN SAY SCIPTS ARE NOT THAT MUCH ADVANCE.SO DON'T INDEPENDENTLY DEPEND ON THE RESULT THEY PROVIDE 
PLEASE DO A CROSS-CHECK AFTER USING THESE SCRIPTS.
